# Flutter Smile To Face Detection

In this project I implemented the custom painter illustrated in the last video released by Flutter Team:: [Custom painting in Flutter - Flutter In Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvI_NUXK00s&t=4s). 

<div style="text-align: center"><table><tr>
  <td style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://github.com/giandifra/Flutter-Smile-Face-Detection/blob/master/smile_image.jpg">
    <img src="https://github.com/giandifra/Flutter-Smile-Face-Detection/blob/master/smile_image.jpg" width="200"/></a>
    <a href="https://github.com/giandifra/Flutter-Smile-Face-Detection/blob/master/smile_live_camera.jpg">
    <img src="https://github.com/giandifra/Flutter-Smile-Face-Detection/blob/master/smile_live_camera.jpg" width="200"/></a>
</td>
</tr></table></div>

## Issues

[ ] In Live Camera mode, with front camera, the smile image is painted in opposite direction in the horizontal axis.
